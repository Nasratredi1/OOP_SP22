Abstract is what exist only at concept level, that have
no phasical existance e.g: food, furniture, shape.
mostly ma'am ap sy pochty han ke kya banaye ajj rat ko. to ap kahengy ki
food banayee, not have phasical existance.

* Imp point: Agr hamary class mein 1 method bhi abstract(incomplete) han. to class is
also mandator to be abstract.

Abstract mean: we can't make an object of this.

Abstract method don't have a body.

* Abstract classes are incomplet. We can delare
method in abstract class that sub-clasess shall
implement i.e: difine the method body.

if you not define that method in child class: then
error came said that: you must implement that merthod or declare that
class abstract.

#    Concret class ####
are those which we make object of that class.

# Abstract method may have static or instance attribute or
non abstract method in his own class.

If there is at least one abstract method the class must
be declare abstract.

* Constructor, private and static method cannot be
declare abstract.

* we can create reference variable of abstract class to
process objects of sub-classes generilly/ polymorphically
